# Globally and Locally Consistent Image Completion

Unofficial Tensorflow implementation of the [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3072959.3073659), which proposed a idea that completing image by two discriminator. If you want to read the paper detailly, you can find it in my project and the name is [completion_sig2017(1).pdf](https://github.com/CoderAnn/GLCI/introduction/completion_sig2017(1).pdf).

This project only train and test on LFW dataset. I don't varify the effectiveness on other Dataset. 
Please contact me if you have any questions.

Just for fun.

# Requirements
Tensorflow>=1.10.0

# Train
1. download the training data from LFW and put it into DataSet/train/

# Test


Here is my result in LFW.
